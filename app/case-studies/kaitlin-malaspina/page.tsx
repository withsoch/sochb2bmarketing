Visitors came and left without the translation layer that converts interest into inquiry.",
  "Content was sporadic and undirected. Without a consistent presence anchored in Kaitlin's positioning, the right founders had no way to find her or build familiarity before they'd already made a decision, or decided to keep carrying it alone. The content that did go out wasn't building the channel.",

                  Kaitlin had built something that most consultants only describe. Brenna &amp; Co.
                  is a Private Operating House: a firm that steps into the full architectural layer
                  of a founder&rsquo;s business and runs it. The work was distinctive, the track
                  record was real, and the positioning was clear in her mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But LinkedIn was not converting at the level the work deserved. The right founders
                  were on LinkedIn every day. They were just not finding her before they had already
                  found someone else, or decided to keep carrying it alone. She came to Signal House to build
                  the infrastructure that matched what the firm had already built in the real world.

                    It is somewhat ironic that the person who builds operational
                    infrastructure for founders had not built the right infrastructure
                    for her own channel. Signal House fixed that. And they did it without
                    changing what Brenna and Co. is. They just made it visible to
                    the right people at the right moment.
