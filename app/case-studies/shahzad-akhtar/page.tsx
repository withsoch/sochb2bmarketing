Despite two Group CEO roles, AED 500M in managed turnover, a Balanced Scorecard certification from Palladium and Kaplan and Norton, and active engagements with the Asian Development Bank and GIZ, his profile didn't communicate any of that in a way that made the right people reach out.",
  "Content had never been systematic. Without a consistent publishing cadence, there was no mechanism to build authority and visibility with decision-makers who hadn't already encountered him through existing channels. The algorithm punishes inconsistency, and the silence was costing him reach.",

                  Shahzad had spent 28 years doing the work. Two Group CEO roles. AED 500M
                  in managed turnover. A Balanced Scorecard certification from Palladium and
                  Kaplan and Norton. Active engagements with the Asian Development Bank and
                  GIZ. He was the practitioner that other consultants pointed to when the
                  conversation turned to strategy execution in Pakistan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But his LinkedIn told none of that story in a way that generated pipeline.
                  Every new engagement still started from zero, rebuilt on reputation,
                  referral, and being in the right room. He came to Signal House to fix that:
                  to build a presence that did the introduction before the meeting, and
                  shortened the trust-building cycle with the right people.

                    Before this, my entire pipeline came from people who already knew
                    me. Now the content does the introduction. By the time someone
                    books a call, they have already decided I am the right person.
                    The conversion rate is completely different.
