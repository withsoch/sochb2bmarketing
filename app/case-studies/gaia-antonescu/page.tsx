There was no clear point of view, nothing that told a prospective client why Gaia specifically, why Byzantine specifically. Visitors landed and left with no strong reason to reach out.",
  "Content was inconsistent and reactive. When she had a thought worth sharing, she'd post. Most weeks, nothing went out. There was no strategy, no rhythm, and no system for turning her genuine expertise into material that reached the right people. The algorithm punishes inconsistency, and it was.",

                  Gaia had built Byzantine into a respected boutique strategy firm
                  through referrals and reputation. She knew LinkedIn mattered:
                  her clients were there, her peers were there, and the conversations
                  she wanted to be part of were happening there daily. But LinkedIn had
                  always felt like a chore. She&rsquo;d post sporadically when she had
                  time, struggle to know what to say, and watch the engagement flatline.
                  Her profile still read like a CV from three years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She came to Signal House not because she didn&rsquo;t understand LinkedIn, but
                  because she understood it well enough to know she wasn&rsquo;t doing it
                  justice. She needed a partner who could take full ownership of her
                  presence, strategy, content, and outreach, so she could
                  stay focused on running the business. We started with a full audit
                  before touching anything. You don&rsquo;t fix what you haven&rsquo;t
                  properly diagnosed.
