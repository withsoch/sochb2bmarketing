  "Biola's LinkedIn profile wasn't telling her story. The headline led with job title. The About section listed activities without communicating the mission or the why. There was no clear articulation of what Cycle Together is, who it's for, or why Biola is the person building it. Visitors came and left without understanding the depth of what she was doing.",
  "Content had been tried and abandoned. Biola had the ideas, she thinks clearly and cares deeply about the space, but converting that into a consistent LinkedIn presence felt overwhelming on top of everything else she was running. Posts went out in bursts and then went quiet for weeks. The inconsistency was costing her visibility and credibility with the exact audience she needed to build.",
  "Partnership outreach was happening informally: conversations through mutual connections, emails that didn't always land, and no systematic way to reach the corporate wellness teams and sport organisations who would benefit from partnering with Cycle Together. The opportunity was there. The process to capture it wasn't.",

We ran a positioning session to extract the core beliefs, the community story, and the specific language Biola uses when she talks about inclusion and access in sport. This became the foundation for everything: profile, content, and outreach.",

The About section opened with the founding story: the moment Biola knew cycling needed to change, and moved into what the community has become and where it's going. The result was a profile that any corporate wellness lead, sport organisation, or community funder could land on and immediately understand.",

Within 60 days, follower growth had tripled against the previous 60-day baseline.",

                <p>
                  Biola built Cycle Together from a personal belief: that cycling
                  should be for everyone, regardless of background, ability, or budget.
                  What started as a grassroots community initiative had grown into
                  something with real momentum: events, partnerships, and a growing
                  following of people who shared her vision. But on LinkedIn, none of
                  that came through.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her profile read like a professional CV, not a founder story. Her
                  content was sporadic and unfocused. And the people she most needed to
                  reach, corporate sponsors, sport and wellness organisations,
                  community funders, and like-minded founders, had no easy way
                  to find her or understand what Cycle Together stood for. She came to
                  Social Catalyst to fix that. Not to grow follower numbers for their own sake, but
                  to make her LinkedIn presence do actual work for her mission.
