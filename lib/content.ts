    a: "Yes. No trial, no card, no call to sit through. We do it because a written plan is the most honest sample of our work we can hand you. If you want help running it, ask for a quote. If you'd rather run it yourself, take it and go.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do you need from me?",
    a: "A link to your Instagram or your Google listing, and an email address to send the report to. If you're on LinkedIn as well, add that link and we'll cover it too.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take?",
    a: "The report lands within 24 hours of you sending it. If it's been longer, email riz@soovita.com and we'll chase it. A person reads every submission, so now and then one gets stuck behind another.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will this just be a pitch?",
    a: "No. It's a plan you can act on without us. There is one line at the end offering a quote. Everything above that line is work.",

    q: "Which platforms do you look at?",

  },
  {
    q: "How does working together work?",
    a: "We start by going through the audit findings together. From there most businesses pick a package covering the channels that matter most to them. You approve everything before it goes live.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I have ready?",

export const FAQS: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "I paid an agency before and got a monthly PDF for it.",
    a: "That's a fair thing to hold against us. Two differences you can check for yourself: you approve every post before it goes live, so you see the work as it happens instead of reading a summary a month later. And the report is one page that says how many people asked Google for your contact details. If the work stops, you'll notice in week one, not in month six.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before I see anything?",
    a: "Google can move inside two weeks, because that part is just becoming findable: claimed profile, right categories, real photos. Content and reviews take longer, usually two to three months before it shows up in inquiries. Anyone promising you next Tuesday is guessing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if it doesn't work?",
    a: "Then after six months you still own a rebuilt Google profile, a claimed listing, a stack of new reviews and a few hundred posts. That's the floor. The honest part: we can make you easy to find and worth choosing. We can't fix an offer that doesn't hold up once someone's tried it, and we'll tell you on the call if we think that's the real problem.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to be on TikTok, or run ads?",
    a: "No to both. TikTok sits on two of the five packages and plenty of businesses skip it. Paid ads only sit on the Full package, and the budget goes from you straight to the platform so you see the real cost. For most B2B businesses, LinkedIn, Google and a steady content calendar do more than either.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much of my week does this take?",
    a: "About 20 minutes a month approving the content calendar, plus one 30-minute call at the start. You don't write captions, pick photos or answer reviews. We will ask how your business talks, once, so the captions sound like you in both Estonian and English. If a month needs more than that from you, we've built it wrong.",
