    q: "What do you need from me?",

    q: "How long does it take?",
    a: "The report lands within 24 hours of you sending it. If it's been longer, email riz@soovita.com and we'll chase it. A person reads every submission, so now and then one gets stuck behind another.",

  {
    q: "I paid an agency before and got a monthly PDF for it.",
    a: "That's a fair thing to hold against us. The difference you can check for yourself: you approve every post before it goes live, so you see the work as it happens instead of reading a summary a month later. If the work stops, you'll notice in week one, not in month six.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before I see anything?",
    a: "Google can move inside two weeks, because that part is just becoming findable: claimed profile, right categories, real photos. Content and reviews take longer, usually two to three months before it shows up in inquiries. Anyone promising you next Tuesday is guessing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if it doesn't work?",
    a: "Then after six months you still own a rebuilt Google profile, a claimed listing, a stack of new reviews and a few hundred posts. That's the floor. The honest part: we can make you easy to find and worth choosing. We can't fix an offer that doesn't hold up once someone's tried it, and we'll tell you on the call if we think that's the real problem.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to be on TikTok?",
    a: "No. TikTok sits on two of the five packages and plenty of businesses skip it. For most B2B businesses, LinkedIn, Google and a steady content calendar do more.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much of my week does this take?",
    a: "About 20 minutes a month approving the content calendar, plus one 30-minute call at the start. You don't write captions, pick photos or answer reviews. We will ask how your business talks, once, so the captions sound like you. If a month needs more than that from you, we've built it wrong.",
